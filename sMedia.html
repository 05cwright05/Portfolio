              I am Caden Wright, a driven and accomplished 4.0 senior at Castle High
              School, seeking admission into a computer science program and career
              opportunities in the field. As a baritone in the marching band, I have
              honed discipline and teamwork while showcasing my musical talent.
              Additionally, my active involvement in St. John the Baptist Church's
              youth group has instilled in me empathy, leadership, and a commitment
              to community service. Alongside my extracurricular engagements, I have
              a strong passion for computer science, demonstrated through my
              self-taught programming skills and the development of innovative
              programs. With a diverse skill set, exceptional academic performance,
              and an unwavering determination, I am ready to make meaningful
              contributions to the computer science world and embark on a successful
              academic and professional journey.
